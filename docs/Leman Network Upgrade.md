On this page you will find all information regarding the Leman Network Upgrade. The Leman Network Upgrade is the next step in the development of Alephium and will bring new functionalities and features to the blockchain.

## Why the Leman Upgrade?

Alephium has been live on mainnet since Nov 8th 2021. The core dev team has since focused on increasing the performance and security of the whole stack, as well as enabling a top-of-the-class dApp developer experience.

After a time on testnet, the Leman Upgrade brings these important improvements to the mainnet. As these changes are significant, the upgrade will introduce new features and changes that are not be backward-compatible, requiring an upgrade of all nodes.

## Improved devX experience for developers

One of the key benefits of the Leman Upgrade is a completely revamped suite of tools and experiences for developers building on top of Alephium. Everything becomes more powerful, easier to use and even more secure. 

### SDK

The SDK is brand new. There is everything you need to interact with Alephium and develop dApps from CLI tool to core/base packages, wallets & test related functions, etc…

### Ralph

Ralph has also seen a lot of improvements over the past year. These include dynamic array indexing, constants, error code, and debugging. The Asset Permission System (APS) has also been updated with a new syntax that makes it much more intuitive to approve assets. 

Overall, Ralph has been designed to be simple and efficient for smart contract development, and the team feels that this goal has been achieved:
